## About The Project

The project is a complaint chat, the project aims to be applied in a factory or a service location where the use of cell phones is restricted, either due to lack of signal or to increase employee productivity (avoiding distractions caused by it). 
Each sector of the company must have a machine with the software interface accessible to all, where they will request a token to communicate with the sector responsible for environmental security. 
There is also the interface that will be used by analysts where complaints/warnings will be handled, those responsible will forward them to the sector capable of solving the incident or providing assistance, guiding the user to perform the necessary procedure.
